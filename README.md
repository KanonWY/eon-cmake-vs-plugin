## eon cmake plugin
This is only for eon cmake api. make sure you have eon-cli!
## Notice
This plug fork from https://github.com/twxs/vs.language.cmake/tree/master, so it no need to install it again!
As I am a CPP developer, I am not very familiar with TS syntax. Perhaps there are some bugs in the plugin. I suggest raising an issue on Git, I will try fix it!
